# bismillah-twopointoh
Hello and welcome to bismillah-twopointoh, the second repo for my Congressional App project bismillah! bismillah is a site I 
made to advocate for better Muslim representation, as well as promote Muslim voices. In hopes of launching this site to the public, 
I'm attempting to make it live on github pages. This is my first time doing something of this scale, and this is me starting over
since it didn't work the first time. Feel free to look around. 
For any inquiries, please email wishmorethewitch@gmail.com
