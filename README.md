# bismillah-twopointoh
Hello and welcome to bismillah-twopointoh, the second repo for my Congressional App project bismillah! 
bismillah is a site I made to advocate for better Muslim representation, as well as promote Muslim voices. The site features various informational content including important vocabulary, essays on Muslim representation, a database of Muslim voices, resources, and more. 
You can view the site live here: https://warramma.github.io/bismillah-twopointoh/
